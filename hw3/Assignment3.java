     1. PUBLIC - "Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest."(ACM Ethics)
     -- A software engineer intentionally and publicly shares untrue information about a service that their program
     will supposedly be providing in coming months, investors and the general public are mislead as a result of this.
     An act like this blatantly qualifies as a violation of the first principle in
     the software engineering code of ethics.

    2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER - "Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests
    of their client and employer, consistent with the public interest." (ACM Ethics)
    -- A software engineer agrees to deliver a specific project to a client that they do not fully understand, or
    do not have the required competency with the tools required to successfully deliver a quality software to their
    client because they misrepresented their capabilities. This act obviously violates this principle.

    3. PRODUCT - Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications
    meet the highest professional standards possible." (ACM Ethics)
    -- A software engineer provides an inaccurate or rushed estimate on the cost, quality, and timeline of a
    proposed project to the client. This clearly violates the 3rd principle.

    4. JUDGMENT - "Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment."
    (ACM Ethics)
    -- A software engineer realizes that the service provided by his company has been slightly overcharging clients
     without their knowledge and, instead of bringing this to the attention of the appropriate people,
    the software engineer keeps this discovery to themself. This would be a clear violation of this principle.

    5. MANAGEMENT - "Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach
    to the management of software development and maintenance." (ACM Ethics)
    -- A team leader or manager acts unprofessionally and verbally assaults a team member over an error the colleague
    failed to fix before a given deadline. This type of behavior being exhibited by management is a violation of this
    principle.
